# Kilovolt blog

**Author**: Tim & Khaliil
**Version**: 3.0.0

## Overview
This application is a responsive blog that uses jquery methods to filter specific blog posts by author or category using event handlers. We must build out the event handlers to display selected filters and hide the rest.

## Getting Started
Start with basic html and css stylings, then tie in the jQuery library to generate article data within an object constructor to post to the blog. Event handlers are then added to show/hide content as requested

## Architecture
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used in this blog while linking to CDN for jQuery methods. The index also has access to additional fonts, icons and images through provided CSS documents.
